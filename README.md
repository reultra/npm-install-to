# @reultra/npm-install-to

A module to install NPM dependencies to a custom location, with support for NPM workspaces.

This is particularly useful for projects that need to package dependencies prior to deployment such as Electron apps, AWS Lambda functions, etc.

This module will be deprecated once the PR has been merged in NPM cli.
